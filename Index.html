      BLESSED TO HAVE A FAMILY THAT SUPPORTED MY
      DECISION, I STARTED LEARNING HOW TO PORGRAM
      WITH AN INTRODUCTION SCRATCH, A YEAR LATER I
      WOULD LATERON STUMBLE UPON MY FIRST OOP
      LANGUAGE CALLED JAVA WHERE I WOULD STUDY IT
      FOR MY GCSEs WHERE I WOULD REALLY TAKE A HUGE
      INTEREST INTO PROGRAMMING AND I WOULD DO SMALL

  <h3>HOBBIES</h3>
  <p>DURING MY DOWNTIME I LIKE TO WATCH ANIME(ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧
    YES I AM A WEEB, BUT WHEN I’M NOT BINGE WATCHING ANIME,
    I LOVE TO WATCH YOUTUBE CONTENT CREATORS SUCH AS LINUS
    TECH TIPS, MKBHD, CHROME UNBOXED AND MANY MORE. HOWEVER
    WHEN I’M IN THE MOOD TO GO OUTSIDE AND SOCIALISE, I LIKE
    TO GO TO MY LOCAL BASKETBALL COURT AND PLAY A PICK UP
    GAME WITH ANYONE WHO IS THERE. I ALSO LIKE TO HELP OUT
    AT MY YOUTH CHURCH WHERE I’M A MENTOR AND A LEADER,
    THIS MEANS THAT I’MN SEEN AS A ROLE MODEL AND SOMEONE
    THAT THE YOUTH AT MY CHURACH ARE ABLE TO TALK TO IF THEY
    NEED ADVICE AND HELP
