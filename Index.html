    <h2>Who is Itsejuwa</h2>
    <p class = trial>
    I'm a 19 year old developer who is currently learning Web design and FullStack Kotlin Development. I studied Computer Science at the University of Essex, however after completing
    my first year I had to a giant conclusion that University wasn't the right learning ground for me.

    <h2>Journey into Software Development </h2>
    <p class = trial>
    Without making this sound like a personal statement, I've always been interested in Software Development since I was 13, I was blessed to have a family that supported my deccision.
    I started learning how to program with an introduction Scratch, a year later I would later on stumble upon my first OOP language called Java where I would study it for my GCSEs.
    Next I would change a prefrence in language from Java to Kotlin where I would really take a huge interest into programming and I would do small kotlin tasks to hone in my skills.

    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
    <p class = trial> During my Downtime I like to watch Anime (ﾉ◕ヮ◕)ﾉ*:･ﾟ✧ Yes I am a weeb, but when I'm not binge watching anime. I love to watch youtube Content Creators such as Linus Tech Tips, MKBHD, chrome unboxed and many more. However when I'm in the mood to go outside and socialise, I like to go to my local basketball court and play a pick up game with anyone who is there. I also  like to help out at my youth church where I'm a mentor and a leader, this means that I'm seen as a role model and someone that the youth at my church are able to talk to if they need any sort of help
